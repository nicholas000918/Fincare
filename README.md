# Fincare
# Project Overview 
Fincare is an application that teaches users of age 18 to 30 about financial literacy and management. 
The reason why we focus on financial literacy and management is due to many youths who are unaware about the importance of being financially literate and how to build 
their wealth from the ground. This application will provide functions such as gaining access to ebooks about wealth management and financial knowledge, collaboration 
with financial institutions to create tailored made financial courses at all levels and community forums for youths who are interested to discuss and read about financial
topics posted in them.

# Purpose and Objective
The purpose of the software planning project tool is to provide functions such as Gantt Chart, Work breakdown structure and network diagram to plan and breakdown the 
tasks to each member in our team for carrying out the work properly. We are using plan-driven development for our project Fincare, so software project planning plays a 
vital part in the development of our Fincare project. As the software project planning tool is invented, several tasks can be completed and well coordinated. The main 
purpose of this application is to teach youths of age 18 to 30 to be more financially literate.

# Intended Users and Stakeholders 
For our Fincare project, we have some intended users and stakeholders. 
Stakeholders: Youths of age 18 to 30, Financial institutions, Ebook companies.

# Product Scope 
The main goal of our product is to help youths to be more financially literate and prevent them from falling into financial crisis. To solve this problem statement, we 
are planning to build a mobile application product called Fincare which provides materials and professional tips to improve youthsâ€™ financial literacy. Furthermore, we 
will also provide functionalities such as wealth management and spending tracker to allow youths to control their monthly expenditure. To build this product, we need 
professions such as product manager, software engineer, stakeholders such as financial institutions and Ebook companies and youths of age 18 to 30 to gain user requirement.
The estimated timeline to build this project is about 14 weeks based on the gantt chart.
